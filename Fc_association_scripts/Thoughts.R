#Thoughts ####

#Route 1
#Prune for LD
#Take our most significant snps
#Then look to see what they are in LD with in terms of SNPs with functional consequences
#Include these in the analysis


#Route2
#Take sig SNPs and include functional snps that are in LD
#Prune but prioritise, sig and functional snps

#Route 3
#Group SNPs that are in LD together and then do haplotype analysis 
#I think do this anyways
